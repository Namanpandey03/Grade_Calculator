# 🎓 Grade Calculator (Basic Version)

This is a simple Python project that allows you to input marks for multiple students and calculate their average scores and grades.

It's designed for beginners who are learning Python and want to build real-world mini projects.  
This is my first project as an aspiring Data Analyst learning Python!
