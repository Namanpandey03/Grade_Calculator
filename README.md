# 🎓 Grade Calculator (Basic Version)

This is a simple Python project that allows you to input marks for multiple students and calculate their average scores and grades.

It's designed for beginners who are learning Python and want to build real-world mini projects.  
This is my first project as an aspiring Data Analyst learning Python!

## 📌 Features

- Accepts names and marks for multiple students.
- Calculates average percentage.
- Assigns grades based on average:
  - A+: 90% and above
  - A: 80–89%
  - B: 70–79%
  - C: 60–69%

## 🔄 Update: Version 2

This version introduces a **save feature**.  
- After calculating grades, the program asks if you want to save the results.  
- If you choose to save, the grades are stored in a text file (`grades.txt`) inside the project folder.  
- This makes it easy to keep track of your grades over time.
